The Movie Ticket Booking System is a C++ console application designed to facilitate movie ticket reservations for users and streamline management tasks for administrators. Through an intuitive interface, users can browse available movies, and book tickets effortlessly. Administrators have access to functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting movies, managing showtimes, and monitoring bookings.

The system employs object-oriented programming principles to organize movie details, handle user interactions, and manage bookings efficiently. Users are guided through a user-friendly menu system where they can navigate movie listings, select preferred showtimes, and reserve tickets seamlessly. Administrators, on the other hand, have exclusive access to administrative features, allowing them to maintain an up-to-date database of movies, manage show schedules, and monitor ticket sales.

By leveraging C++'s robust features and console-based interface, the Movie Ticket Booking System provides a reliable and efficient platform for moviegoers to book tickets conveniently while offering administrators the tools they need to oversee and manage movie screenings effectively.
